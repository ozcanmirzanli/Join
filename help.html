        Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
        project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join
        is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
        the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is
        a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
        maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban
        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
        interface. It is important to note that Join is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
        While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
        aspects of quality regarding Join.
        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:
        <h3>1. Exploring the Board </h3>
        When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents
        your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress",
        “Await feedback” and "Done".
        <h3>2. Creating Contacts</h3>
        In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
        "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
        information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they
        can interact with the tasks on the board.
        <h3>3. Adding Cards</h3>
        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
        represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
        list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
        task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        <h3>4. Moving Cards</h3>
        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
        board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
        <h3>5. Deleting Cards</h3>
        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
        delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
        Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
        irreversible. Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent
        updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
        state of your project. Have more questions about Join? Feel free to
